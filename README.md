## Hello World!

This is Lydia, I'm very passionate about data mining, data analytics, and machine learning. It opens up a new door to me and keeps me hungry. I've taken Coursera Machine Learning Specialist course from UW and I'm now working on Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity! 
I'm a data science consultant, focusing on forecast and prediction. I majorly work with clients' Operation Research team on varies Revenue Management projects, like Pricing, Demand Forecast, and Fleet Management. 

I will keep updating my repositories, and hopefully, become a master data scientist some day! :D
